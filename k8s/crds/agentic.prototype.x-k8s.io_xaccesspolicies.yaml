                            spiffe identities must be specified as SPIFFE-formatted URIs following the pattern:
                              spiffe://<trust_domain>/<workload-identifier>

                            The exact workload identifier structure is implementation-specific.

                            spiffe identities for authorization can be derived in various ways by the underlying
                            implementation. Common methods include:
                            - From peer mTLS certificates: The identity is extracted from the client's
                              mTLS certificate presented during connection establishment.
                            - From IP-to-identity mappings: The implementation might maintain a dynamic
                              mapping between source IP addresses (pod IPs) and their associated
                              identities (e.g., Service Account, SPIFFE IDs).
                            - From JWTs or other request-level authentication tokens.

                            Note for reviewers: While this GEP primarily focuses on identity-based
                            authorization where identity is often established at the transport layer,
                            some implementations might derive identity from authenticated tokens or sources
                            within the request itself.

                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Backend) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor.

                  This field is inherited from the Gateway API Policy status definition.
                  For more details, see the upstream documentation:
                  https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#policyancestorstatus
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                            Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                            the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.
                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                            interpreted.

                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                        <gateway:util:excludeFromCRD>

                        Notes for implementors:

                        Conditions are a listType `map`, which means that they function like a
                        map with a key of the `type` field _in the k8s apiserver_.

                        This means that implementations must obey some rules when updating this
                        section.

                        * Implementations MUST perform a read-modify-write cycle on this field
                          before modifying it. That is, when modifying this field, implementations
                          must be confident they have fetched the most recent version of this field,
                          and ensure that changes they make are on that recent version.
                        * Implementations MUST NOT remove or reorder Conditions that they are not
                          directly responsible for. For example, if an implementation sees a Condition
                          with type `special.io/SomeField`, it MUST NOT remove, change or update that
                          Condition.
                        * Implementations MUST always _merge_ changes into Conditions of the same Type,
                          rather than creating more than one Condition of the same Type.
                        * Implementations MUST always update the `observedGeneration` field of the
                          Condition to the `metadata.generation` of the Gateway at the time of update creation.
                        * If the `observedGeneration` of a Condition is _greater than_ the value the
                          implementation knows about, then it MUST NOT perform the update on that Condition,
                          but must wait for a future reconciliation and status update. (The assumption is that
                          the implementation's copy of the object is stale and an update will be re-triggered
                          if relevant.)
